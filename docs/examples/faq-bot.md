### 5. Help Menu

Response Type: Text
Response Text:
🤖 How can I help you?

Type any of these:
• "hours" - Business hours
• "location" - Office address
• "contact" - Contact info
• "pricing" - See our prices
• "sales" - Talk to sales team
• "support" - Get help with issues
```

## Tips

1. **Set higher priority for Help** - So "help" doesn't match other rules with "Contains"

2. **Use Contains for flexibility** - Matches "what are your hours?" and "business hours"

3. **Add emojis sparingly** - Makes messages more readable

4. **Include next steps** - Guide users to other options

## Testing

Send these messages:
- "hello" → Default response (or greeting if configured)
- "help" → Help menu
- "what are your business hours?" → Business hours response
- "where are you located" → Location response
